## 🏗 Architecture

This project follows a **microservices architecture**, where each service is independently deployable and scalable.

### Backend Services

- **auth-service**
  - User registration & login
  - JWT issuance

- **users-service**
  - User profile & metadata storage
  - Decoupled from authentication

- **posts-service**
  - CRUD operations for posts
  - Likes, views, dashboard endpoints

- **comments-service**
  - Add & fetch comments for posts
  - Linked with post and user IDs

### Frontend

- **React + TypeScript**
- Communicates with backend services over HTTP
- JWT stored client-side and sent via `Authorization` header

## 🚧 Currently Working On (18th Dec 2025)

- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Adding AI-assisted post writing, summarization, and basic content moderation as a separate service.
- 💬 **Comment Service**: Enhancing comment features with better attribution, optimized fetching, and support for threaded discussions.
- ⚡ **Latency Optimization**: Reducing inter-service latency through query optimization, indexing, and planned Redis caching for high-traffic data.
